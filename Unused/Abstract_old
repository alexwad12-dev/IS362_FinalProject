IS362 Final Project Abstract Brainstorming and Processing


### Phase 1: Setup & Data Acquisition (The "ET" in ETL)

**Goal:** Get the raw data into a usable format.
**Advice:** *Do not* try to scrape every single week of the Billboard charts. Use the **"Year-End"** charts for the last 10 years. This is a necessary "simplifying assumption" to keep your project manageable.

* **Task 1.1: GitHub Repo Setup**
    * Create a public repo.
    * Create a `.gitignore` file (include your API keys/tokens here so you don't accidentally publish them!).
    * *Satisfies: Reproducible code.*

* **Task 1.2: Scrape Billboard Data (The "Skeleton")**
    * Use `BeautifulSoup` or `pandas.read_html` to scrape the "Billboard Year-End Hot 100" for 2013–2023.
    * Extract: Rank, Song Title, Artist.
    * *Satisfies: Data Source #1 (Scraped web page).*

* **Task 1.3: Spotify API Integration (The "Audio Features")**
    * Register for a Spotify Developer account to get a Client ID/Secret.
    * Use the `spotipy` library.
    * Loop through your Billboard list to search for the Track ID, then fetch Audio Features (Valence, Energy).
    * *Satisfies: Data Source #2 (Web API).*

* **Task 1.4: Genius Lyrics (The "Sentiment")**
    * *Note:* Scraping Genius can be tricky. Use the `lyricsgenius` library (wrapper) to make this easier.
    * Fetch lyrics for the songs in your list.
    * *Satisfies: Strengthening the "New Feature" requirement.*

### Phase 2: Transformation & Cleaning (The "T" in ETL)

**Goal:** Turn raw JSON/HTML into a clean Pandas DataFrame.

* **Task 2.1: The "New Feature" (Sentiment Analysis)**
    * Use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library not heavily covered in class (e.g., `TextBlob` or `NLTK` VADER).
    * Run the lyrics through the analyzer to generate a "Lyric Polarity Score."
    * *Satisfies: "One feature not covered in class."*

* **Task 2.2: Data Transformation**
    * Convert the 'Year' column to a proper Datetime object.
    * Create a specific subset (e.g., Filter for only top 10 songs of each year vs. the rest).
    * *Satisfies: At least one data transformation operation.*

### Phase 3: Analysis & Visualization (The "L" and Analysis)

**Goal:** Prove your hypothesis and validate the data.

* **Task 3.1: Data Validation Graphic**
    * Create a histogram or boxplot of the "Valence" (musical positivity) scores.
    * Check for outliers (e.g., is there a song with 0 valence?).
    * *Satisfies: Graphic that describes/validates data.*

* **Task 3.2: Aggregation**
    * Group the data by `Year`. Calculate the **Mean** Valence and **Mean** Lyric Sentiment per year.
    * *Satisfies: At least one grouping or aggregation.*

* **Task 3.3: Conclusion Graphic**
    * Plot a dual-axis line chart:
        * Line A: Average Spotify Valence over time.
        * Line B: Average Lyric Sentiment over time.
    * Annotate significant cultural events on the timeline (e.g., "Pandemic Start").
    * *Satisfies: Graphic that supports your conclusion.*

* **Task 3.4: Statistical Analysis**
    * Run a correlation (Pearson) between Audio Valence and Lyric Sentiment. Do sad-sounding songs actually have sad lyrics?
    * *Satisfies: Statistical analysis supporting conclusion.*

### Phase 4: Presentation & Final Polish

**Goal:** Ensure the Professor can run it and understands it.

* **Task 4.1: The "Reproducibility" Check**
    * Restart your Kernel and "Run All."
    * **Crucial:** If scraping takes too long (e.g., >5 mins), save your clean data to a CSV, upload that CSV to GitHub, and have your notebook load the CSV from the raw GitHub URL. This prevents the code from timing out during grading.
    * *Satisfies: Code runs without errors.*

* **Task 4.2: Draft the Presentation**
    * **Slide 1:** Motivation (Why music & culture?).
    * **Slide 2:** The Workflow (Diagram of APIs/Scraping).
    * **Slide 3:** The Challenge (e.g., "Matching Billboard song names to Spotify search results was hard because of spelling differences").
    * **Slide 4:** The Insight (e.g., "Music became audibly sadder in 2020, but lyrics remained hopeful").
    * *Satisfies: All Presentation checklist items.*
