I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Now)

Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Men's)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
Goodwill
Poppin' tags, yeah

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on)

Hahaha, alright
Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on 
Shark Week
, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (
Hey, hey, hey
)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (
Hey, hey, hey
)
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up

'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass

43,2013-01-01,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis FeaturingMary Lambert,"When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it


And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?

Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's all right (That's all right)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I
Am, oh, who am I? Mm-mm
Mm-mm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I see
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on, oh, come on

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breakin' for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I'd called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen, no
It's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh
For the best, you didn't listen

I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the boss staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell them Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet

I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

To test the limits and break through

She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (
Get lost
)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (
Get lost
)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

Don't **** with my love

No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now

Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""

You bet your life on it, yeah

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts

I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken

You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love

Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays

I'll try anything to drown out the pain

And only 92 in Daytona

Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads

That's those big white walls, r-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rollin' in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man, I'm loungin'
In some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
Lookin' down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashin'
I'm duckin', buckin' them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge
The same one we'd walk across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school
Candy paint, two-seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And rolled on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in, as I was leavin' I started screamin'

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky

White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it

92,2015-01-01,Don't,Ed Sheeran,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (
Get lost
)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (
Get lost
)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be

And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet

I don't, but you still hit my phone up

Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories

I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Remember life and then your life becomes a better one

Trump claimed he was strong, and said that Hillary was weak
Acted like her health was on the table to critique
Evoking gender bias was a key to his campaign
News outlets spread his quotes, and also deserve the blame
Trump was biased, biased, biased, and discriminated
Trump’s attacks also aimed at those who immigrated
Appealed to those with money anxieties
Small chance of mobility, they suffered quietly
Saw free trade as a tool of the upper class
Trump said he’d  put America first and other countries last
Yeah, Trumpman, Trumpman, he don't need no introduction

Called them criminals and rapists, he was always hating, wow

Trumpman received the most coverage during the election oh
In media analysis, this has caused a lot of tension whoa
Spreading his words helped to ensure his selection oh!

Heard he wanted to make America Great,
Instead he tried to make America hate,
Alluded to when white males were in control
Women and minorities only had a secondary role

No excess crudity caused his destruction
He said he wanted to grab women by the (what?)
Encouraged punching protesters right in the gut

Tuned out minorities’ objections, whoa
But look at a count of the ballots, when the people spoke, like whoa
At the end of the day, Hillary still got the popular vote!

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up

How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready

76,2016-01-01,Lost Boy,Ruth B,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods

I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I'll forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you, and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark

I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way

One works down by the coast

One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife

And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember

Started talkin' 'bout us again

And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck

To carry love, to carry children of our own

Fightin' against all odds

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you

I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed (No matter how my life has changed)

Wheezy na área

O painel, é digital, a agenda tá ocupada
Minha cabeça em uma toca, minha mina é boa
Meus primos são loucos, meus primos gostam do Boogie
A vida é incrível, é assim que deveria ser
Estive aqui por dez, mas eu me sinto como um novato
Eu falo pra ela, ""Olhe pra cima"" porque tá nevando no Tootsie's
Reservado por três anos, cara, você não pode nem me reservar
Sou eu e o Lil Baby, essa merda tá ficando louca
Wheezy produziu e o Weezy F. me criou
E ela segurou, então ela tem uma Mercedes
Young Money Records, o Exército, a Marinha
Eles me mandaram 10 mil, eu joguei igual o Brady
O estrangeiro é amarelo igual o Tracee e o K.D
Eu confiei nos meus manos, eles nunca me traíram
Conheci todos esses manos, eles são mais fofos que a Sadie
Quando eu comecei, eu só peguei o que eles me deram
Fiz todos os favores, eles nunca me retribuíram
Funcionou em meu favor, porque ninguém me salvou

Carro novinho em folha não tem chaves
Faça minhas roupas, sem desleixo, por favor
Assim que eu gozar, você pode ir embora
Tenho milhões no banco, tipo, ""Sim, de fato""

Óculos Cartier, eu não vou nem olhar pra você
Ferrari amarela igual o Pikachu
Eu deixei eles esperando e assistindo, o que ele vai fazer
Tenta espiar o que eu faço, tenta roubar meus movimentos
25 mil por um par de tênis novo
O mesmo preço, eu poderia chamar eles e acabar com você
Advogado acusado, ele é Judeu como se ele fosse voodoo
Garoto de verdade, 100 mil numa Evisu
Carros presidenciais deslizam, nós não te vemos
Eu tenho ganhado dinheiro, não tô preocupado com o que ele faz
Eu tô ganhando dinheiro como se eu fosse dos anos 80
Eu e o Drake estamos prestes a lançar, cara, essa merda vai ser louca
Eles sabem que eu sou verdadeiro, venho direto do porão
Eu sou fechado com as ruas, cara, eu venho da calçada
Um milhão, todas as centenas, isso deixa eles loucos
Wah-wah-wah, vadia, eu sou o baby

An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe

I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe

Solo lloro sin motivo
Solo rezo sin motivo
Solo pienso por la vida, por los días
Por las horas y otra como respirando
Lo hice todo porque se sintió bien
Lo dejarías todo si se sintió mal
Mejor vive tu vida
Nos estábamos quedando sin tiempo

Küçük bir çocuk olduğum sıralar, aşık oldum
Eskiden bize elele tutşsak o bile yeterdi be oğlum
Sonra biz büyüdük, birbirimize dokunmaya başladık
Okul otobüsünün arkasındaki ışığın dibinde öpüşürdük eskiden
Ah be, baban pek benden hoşlanmazdı
Ve ona senin benim için doğru kişi olduğun söylediğimde bana bir parça bile inanmadı
Ah ama kız her gece pencereden sızıp dışarı çıkmanın yolunu buldu

O bir zamanlar benimle doğu yakasında buluşurdu
Güneşin batmak bilmediği o şehirde
Ve sen de biliyorsun bunu biz her gün
Mavi renkli bir Corvette'la arka sokaklarda dolaşırdık
Bebeğim, biliyorsun sen de bu geceliğine sadece bir yerlere sıvışmak istiyorum
Istediğim her yere gidebiliriz

Sahile doğru süreriz arabayı, atla koltuğa
Yalnızca elimi tut benim ve benle gel, evet
Aklımıza koyduğumuz her şeyi yapabiliriz
Tüm hayatını önüne koy ve sonra bir plan çiz
Benim sevgim senindir eğer sen de onu almaya gönüllüysen tabii
Kalbini bana bahşet zira ben onu kırmayacağım
O zaman gel ve bugünden başlayalım
Farklı bi beldede yeni bir hayata başlayalım
Sevginin bu fikirle ortaya çıktığını ikimizde biliyoruz
Bu yüzdendir ki bebeğim, benle uzaklara gel, gel

17 yaşındaydık ve aile olma hayalimiz vardı
Bir evimiz ve içinde aramızdaki her şeyin olduğu
Ve sonra, ah, bir anda 23 yaşına basıverdik
Şimdilerdeyse hayat denen şeyi daha da ciddiye almak zorunda kaldık
Bizi kariyer sahibi yapmayacak işlerimiz ve ödememiz gereken faturalarımız
Eski dostlarımıza ve tanıdık düşmanlara sahibiz
Küçük bir çocuk olduğum zamana dönüp düşünüyorumda
Aşık olduğum o günleri

O bir zamanlar benimle doğu yakasında buluşurdu
Güneşin batmak bilmediği o şehirde
Ve sen de biliyorsun bunu biz her gün
Mavi renkli bir Corvette'la arka sokaklarda dolaşırdık
Bebeğim, biliyorsun sen de bu geceliğine sadece bir yerlere sıvışmak istiyorum
Istediğim her yere gidebiliriz

Sahile doğru süreriz arabayı, atla koltuğa
Yalnızca elimi tut benim ve benle gel, evet
Aklımıza koyduğumuz her şeyi yapabiliriz
Tüm hayatını önüne koy ve sonra bir plan çiz
Benim sevgim senindir eğer sen de onu almaya gönüllüysen tabii
Kalbini bana bahşet zira ben onu kırmayacağım
O zaman gel ve bugünden başlayalım
Farklı bi beldede yeni bir hayata başlayalım
Sevginin bu fikirle ortaya çıktığını ikimizde biliyoruz
Bu yüzdendir ki bebeğim, benle uzaklara gel, gel

Benle uzaklara gel
Benle uzaklara gel
Benle uzaklara gel
Benle uzaklara gel
Benle uzaklara gel

What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

I hope you know money won't erase the pain

I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

Je m'en rappelle de parcourir le centre commercial avec l'équipe entière
Maintenant un négro n'arrive pas à répondre aux appels parce-que j'empoche gros
Je me réveillais, empochant des liasses de bon matin
J'étais fauché, là j'suis riche, et ces négros sont amers

Toute cette haute couture sur mon corps m'ont fait déraper, déraper, ayy
Sorti droit des affaires sombres, je suis un grand Crip
Si j'ai un pot de lean, je vais siroter, siroter
Je fais s'envoler les liasses avec ma reine comme Lauren et Nipsey
Mais je me suis enrichi sur tous ces négros, je ne l'ai pas oublié, ça
J'ai dû y aller en trimant, je n'ai pas oublié ça
Je saute dans la Maybach maintenant je peux m'asseoir à l'arrière
Ces salopes me connaissent maintenant parce-que je leur jette de grosse liasses
Parce-que je me fais de l'argent maintenant, je sais que tu as entendu ça
Un jeune négro dans l'angle, salope, j'ai dû servir du crack
L'oncle m'a avancé de l'argent, j'ai dû lui ramener des filles de joie en retour
On a gravi avec de l'argent sale, j'ai dû l'nettoyer au lavabo
J'ai débranché le cerveau et ai acheté à ma compagne un nouveau coupé
Qu'importe si t'es du Yah Gang ou si t'es un SuWoop
J'ai une salope de la Nouvelle Orleans et mec, cette chatte c'est indescriptible
Et je suis ce négro maintenant, qui l'aurait sû ?

Givenchy jusqu'à mes pieds, paire de jumelles, je les baise toutes deux
J'enfile une nouvelle Audemars, paillettes comme sur un bâteau
J'étais sollicité sur ma queue, où vous étiez bande de négros ?
Je sais que tu m'as tourné le dos juste pour te faire quelques billets
Maintenant tu fais une embardée, parce-que je suis dans la Maybach noire
De nouveaux diamants sur moi, nique un éblouissement, c'est pas du Snapchat
Parce-que je me faisais payer
Des diamants canaris qui ressemblent à de la limonade
Je dégote à la mère d'mon gosse cette nouvelle Bentayga

yeah, tô curtindo com os Braves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nós pagamos
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nós pagamos

Eu vou aumentar um pouco mais dessa vez
Costumava sonhar em conseguir, agora que eu tenho, não dirijo
Eu tinha um lugar igual a The Varsity, o que você quer?
Você compra 20, eu vou pagar o que você comprar
Eu coloco no estilo, acredito que posso voar
Os manos sabem que eu sou rico, mas eles sabem que não devem tentar
Eu tive um show em Detroit e parei na Revive
E gastei 50 mil com todos os meus manos
Todas essas putas nessas lojas fazem comissão
E além disso, eu dou uma gorjeta, elas tão segurando o meu tamanho
Entro no seu carro e apenas coloco seus piscas
E siga o carro funerário desde que você diga que vai andar
Porque alguém vai morrer se eles mexerem com a gente
Transformei um 5 em um 10, isso é o dobro
Fodendo tudo, ando pela igreja com meu copo duplo
Essa merda é um hábito, tô rezando para que eu desista
Tiger continua com a madeira, faz eles desistirem
Saiba que eu consigo um milhão toda semana vendendo maconha
O parça recebeu a carga, eu posso dormir um pouco
Tenho um pacote pra pegar, eu nem vou embora
Andando, fodendo tudo, empresto o 'Vette para o DT
Mantenho um traficante comigo, eu amo o BG
Correndo atrás da grana desde 12 ou 13 anos
Andando por essas ruas, era eu e o Marquise

Primeiro mano que vingou da quebrada, eles tão curiosos
4 nos carros, cerca de 5 nas jóias
Eu recebo a grana com muitos números, esse é o período que eu consegui colocar seu BM em Amiris
Primeiro mano jovem no A com duas Lams
Ganhei 14 mil, comecei com 14 gramas (No mesmo dia)

Você não devia brincar com aquele cara, ele não é um deles

Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

76,2020-01-01,The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,"Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (
Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have

How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo

Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back
Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh

Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder

If I fall to

Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin', but on and on it goes
But wait
If I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation?
Or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure
This growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going

Tengo sentimientos por ti
Espero que no estés amando a los chicos
¿Cuántos cuerpos tienes?
Ruego que no sea más que unos pocos
Sé que trataste con algunos idiotas
Cuando eras joven y en la escuela
Él tuvo que reventar tu cereza
Pero lo mojé como una piscina
Ella consiguió un nuevo G-Wagon
Ella quiere ir a Highlight Room y mostrarlo
Tengo un cuerpo nuevo, chica, muéstralo
Esto es brasileño, sé que es suave
Tonificado y ella consiguió un paquete de seis
Parece que solía jugar al voleibol
American Express, puedes tenerlo todo
Código para la caja fuerte, puedes tenerlo todo
Al carajo tu página principal, ¿cuál es tu Finsta? Quiero conocer tu verdadero yo
Empezaste a bailar para pagar tu matrícula, chica, quiero saber por lo que has pasado
Quieres una botica o quieres vender cabello, solo dime en qué te gusta
Si sales en público y él quiere tu número, solo dile: ""Mi negro te hará girar""

Algo esta cayendo por tí, nena
Fuma a un negro popular por ti, nena

Demonios, acabo de prender a las noticias y vi que los hombres que nunca tuvieron sexo en la escuela
Están haciendo leyes sobre lo que las mujeres pueden hacer
Tengo que protegerte, soy un hombre hecho, atado, todo el camino, nena
Así que tengo que respetarte
Los negros te pusieron las manos encima en el pasado, inseguro porque tu cuerpo es precioso
Cuatro palabras cuando pienso en ellas son: ""Crujientes, mohosas, polvorientas, oxidadas""
Ocho palabras cuando pienso en nosotros es: ""Fóllame, fóllame, fóllame, fóllame""
Te faltan el respeto y los golpearé
Los textos que envías en subtítulos
Los videos que tenemos alguna vez se filtran, nos volvemos virales o nos volvemos platino
No te preocupes por la historia de tu amiga cuando la tuve sola
Ella intentará ponerle algunos extras, te sacaré de tu zona
Ya sabes cómo es cuando no pueden conseguir una reserva en Carbone
Te dirán que es una noche fría, te dirán que prefieren quedarse en casa, sí
Putas celosas, sí
Y sé lo que dije sobre estar en Vogue
Pero al igual que ese grupo de R&B de los años 90
Chica, una llamada, te pondré en Vogue
Una llamada, tú estás en desfiles
Una llamada, estoy sentado en primera fila
Una llamada equivocada de tu ex negro diciendo estupideces que hará que lo envíen a casa
Una llamada y mis negros a diez dedos
Bajo para irnos a donde yo diga ir
Incluso si tenemos que viajar por todo el mundo
Bajo para llevarte al final del camino, de verdad

No, we don't say ""forever,"" but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows

I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild

She said she loved that I was good at everythin'

Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

He can't rewrite the aggro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountaintops in Paris, cold
J'e veux pas mourir toute seule

Above my head, head, head

Hands above my head, hands together

100,2023-01-01,Watermelon Moonshine,Lainey Wilson,"It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
